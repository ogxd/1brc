# 1️⃣🐝🏎️ The One Billion Row Challenge

My dotnet take on the [1brc](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) challenge.  

It is as of 13/01/2023 the fastest entry of the challenge.  

Leaderboard (measured on my AMD x86 64-bit PC, mileage may vary and there is no official environment to run the benchmark on, unfortunately)
